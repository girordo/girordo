    Hi! 

    I'm a frontend engineer with experience across several types of business.
    I hold a BSc in Biomedical Informatics at Universidade de S√£o Paulo

    I'm a constant learner, right now I'm learning Elixir and Phoenix for curiosity in functional programming.
    I am a communicative and empathetic person

    I'm a Linux open sourcerer since 2004

    I've experience in frontend using React and all ecosystem (Native, Next.js, Redux, Context API, Jest, RTL) and in backend I appreciate work with NestJS and Express, both in monolithic and microservices context and also have experience in DDD, TDD, SOLID and BFF.

    Worked with PostgreSQL, MongoDB and Firebase databases and worked with GCP and AWS.
